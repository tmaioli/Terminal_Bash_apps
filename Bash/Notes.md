# Creating Directories on GitHub

To create a new directory directly within the GitHub web interface, you can utilize one of the three following standard methods depending on your active workflow.

## Method 1: Create a Directory via New File (Easiest)

1. Navigate to your target repository on GitHub.
2. Click the **Add file** button and select **Create new file** from the dropdown menu.
3. In the filename input box, type the name of your new directory followed immediately by a forward slash (for example, `MyNewFolder/`). GitHub will automatically recognize this trailing slash as a directory indicator and generate the folder structure.
4. Since Git cannot track empty directories, you must simultaneously name an initial file inside this new folder (such as `MyNewFolder/.gitkeep` or `MyNewFolder/README.md`).
5. Scroll down to the bottom of the interface, fill out your commit message, and click **Commit new file**.

## Method 2: Upload an Existing Folder

1. Navigate to your target repository on GitHub.
2. Click the **Add file** button and select **Upload files**.
3. Drag and drop a pre-existing folder structure from your local computer directly into the web browser upload drop zone.
4. Scroll down to review the staged files, provide a clear description, and click **Commit changes**.

## Method 3: Using the Web-Based Code Editor

If you are already actively editing a file or inspecting the repository assets within your browser, you can leverage GitHub's native web editor environment.

1. Click the `.` (period) key on your physical keyboard to immediately initialize and load the web-based code editor interface.
2. Right-click anywhere within the file explorer sidebar navigation panel and select **New Folder** from the context menu.
3. Name the newly generated folder appropriately.
4. Ensure you create and place at least one anchor file inside the folder structure before attempting to save your progress.

> **Note:** Git architecture does not track or commit empty directories natively. To ensure a new folder structure persists securely within your remote repository, you must always include at least one initialization file—most commonly a blank `.gitkeep` file—inside the directory bounds.
